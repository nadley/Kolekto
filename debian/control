Description: This package provide the common libraries of the Kolekto project
 .

 .
 * Cool CLI interface (and maybe a web interface to browse collection later)
 * Able to query The Movie Database to collect metadata about movies
 * Able to get informations from files itself depending of the container
   (title, quality, runtime...)
 * As simple as possible: all movies are stored in a directory, a berkley
   database store the metadata for each movie, and a bunch of symlink are
   created depending of the patterns set in the config file ("by actors",
   "by title"...)
 * Easy to extend, really!
